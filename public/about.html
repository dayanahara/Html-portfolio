      <p>I'm a student who doesn't really know what to do. I excell at school, but at the same time suck at it. I do daydream as a habit,
        and I miss my boyfriend when I'm not supposed to have a boyfriend in the first place.
      </p>
      
      <p>All I want is for the world to stop turning. I don't want to give up. I want the world to give up.</p>
