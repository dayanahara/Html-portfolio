<h1>Diana's Movie Recommendations</h1>

<h2>The best movies I've watched so far... or atleast as what I can remember</h2>
<hr>
<h3>20th Century Girl</h3>
<p>This movie would've been better if I haven't seen a spoiler on Facebook. lol. But this is great. It's about friendship, betrayal,
    first love and stuffs. I don't really remember everything but, yeah, plot's good.
</p>
<h3>Five Feet Apart</h3>
<p>Haven't cried in a movie? Then you gotta watch this. Never been so frustrated, yet so sad till I watched this.</p>
<h3>Eternals</h3>
<p>You a fan of Marvels? This movie is for you. </p>
